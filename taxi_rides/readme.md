This repo is an analysis of NYC taxi cab traffic. Data can be found [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). 

The analysis includes an exploration of the data including visualizations of data attributes by taxi zones. There is also an analysis of airport taxi behavior at LGA. A simple queuing model is constructed and Monte-Carlo sampled to capture behavior aspects of taxi queues at the airport.

Thanks!
